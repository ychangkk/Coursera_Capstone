    "## Background & Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "A young couple recently moved from Paris to Toronto and they are looking for a right location to open their first cafe in the city. As Toronto is one of the most diverse and populous cities in Canada, there are lots of business opportunities in various industries, be it banking & finance, tourism, arts & music etc. People from all over the world fly to Toronto on daily basis for conferences / business meetings / traveling, thus giving rise to lots of famous restaurants and cafes. Though there are plenty of options in front of this couple, making decisions is not easy. The market in Toronto is highly developed and thus, comes with intense competition and high investment cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being attracted by the potential return but scared of choosing the wrong neighborhoods, they decided to hire a team of data analysts to conduct detailed research on the Toronto market and suggest a location that provides space for business growth and has a nice environment that support business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, we need to look at both demand side and supply side. Demand side refers to the group of potential customers, supply side refers to the resources needed to run the cafe e.g. ingredients. The former is tied to the revenue of the cafe, while the latter plays a key role in controling the cost of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the factors we need to consider in our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- where's the supply comes from? Venues in each neighborhood e.g. grocery stores that will support the running of cafe business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- where's the demand comes from? What's the level of competition in each neighborhood e.g. looking at the number of cafes in each neighborhood to determine the saturation of market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of project, we want to help this couple find the right location to open their cafe based on market saturation and supply of resources to run the business."
